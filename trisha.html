            <p>Hello Dear , I'm Trisha B. Pajo.,  20 year old studied at EARIST Cavite as a BSIT Major in Drafting. </p>
            <p>I used to  draw when i was high-school, by saving pictures. Then copying those pictures i saved and drawing it. It was fun while im drawing it. My mother told me that when im going to enroll for college, she wants me to pursue this kind of drawings but i didn't trust my myself. Luckily i had talents to  draw. But not good like others but, because of my parents who always supporting me and motivate me. Im giving my best to make them proud. </p>
            <p> I am a youth dancer and youth choir in church. I enjoy when there's meeting talking about for events to encourage kids to serve god. As choir member i experience happiness. I like people who being there for me. Since when i was a kid my parents wants me to join to be a choir, in the first place i can't see my self singing in church. But the help of my parents I can't meet more friends.</p>
            <p>Aside from that, I love playing instruments it makes me feel better after a tiring day. I play guitar. Watching k drama when im bored and when I'm the only one in our house, also i listen to music it makes me calm when i have a bad day. Thanks to music. I feel full charge when listening it. Additionally in this generation everyone's talking about k-pop, i like it to especially there song. without these in my life. I have no longer enjoy my life here in world.</p>
