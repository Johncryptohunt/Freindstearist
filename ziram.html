            <p>I'm Rimando, Mariz O., 20 year old, EARIST Cavite student from BSIT major in Drafting Technology technology, living in Dasmarinas, Cavite.</p>
            <p>I used to enjoy drawing when I was younger. The main thing I liked to draw was the pogs, which became my drawing reference because they have so many anime characters. My parents and other people told me I was good at drawing, and since I was a stupid child, I believed them. My parents also encouraged me to enroll in the drafting course when I was still in grade 9. Drawing is also how I like to think that I am good at something or that I know something, but as time passes, I realize that I have no talent at drawing and can just copy, even if I still find it enjoyable.</p>
             <p>Aside from the arts, I love to watch music videos and read the website stories. I also love music, and I spend a lot of time listening to it. I always make sure to have music playing when I work on something.</p>
